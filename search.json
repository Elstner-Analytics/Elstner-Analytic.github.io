We will store this personal information for the purposes of administering and maintaining records of services or advice we have received and commissioning further services.\nThe personal information we hold about suppliers and professional advisors may be shared with:\n\nother professional advisors;\ncompanies who hold or ‘process’ personal information on our behalf, or cloud-based products.\n\nWe store and process information in this way because it is necessary to:\n\nperform a contract to which you are likely to be a party;\ncomply with a legal or regulatory obligation; and/or\nprotect our legitimate interests in running and promoting our business.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you interact with our digital platforms, we may also automatically collect the following information about your visit:\n\nhow you have reached our digital platform and the internet protocol (IP) address you have used;\nyour browser type, versions and plug-ins, and your operating system;\nyour journey through our digital platform, including which links you click on and any\nsearches you made, how long you stayed on a page, and other page interaction information;\nwhat content you like or share; and\ninformation collected in any forms you complete.\n\nThis is primarily to help us better understand how people use our digital platforms to enable us to create better content and more relevant communications\n\n\nIn some cases, we will not be able to deal with you further without receiving certain information – e.g. ‘Know Your Customer’ information. In such circumstances we will explain this to you including the possible consequences of not providing particular information. In any event EA will only process the personal information you provide to TSMC for the purposes listed above.\n\n\n\nEA avoids wherever possible receiving information on race, religion, political views and your mental or physical health.\n\n\n\nTSMC is based in Europe and does not anticipate transferring your personal data outside the EEA.

If you would like more information about how your personal information may be transferred, please contact us using the information below.\n\n\n\n\nWe wish to build a long-term relationship with you and would like to use personal information that we hold to send you updates about our business, activities and opportunities to work together. We would usually do this by email. You can opt out of receiving updates at any time by contacting us at hello@elstner.dev\n\n\nThe period for which EA will retain personal information will vary depending on the purposes that it was collected for, as well as the requirements of any applicable law or regulation.\n\n\n\nIt is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please let us know if your personal data which we hold changes during your relationship with us.\n\n\n\n\nUnder data protection law, you have rights including:\n\nYour right of access - You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information.\nYour right to rectification - You have the right to ask us to rectify personal information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.\nYour right to erasure - You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances.\nYour right to restriction of processing - You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.\nYour right to object to processing - You have the the right to object to the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.\nYour right to data portability - You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information you gave us to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.\n\nPlease contact us (hello@elstner.dev) if you wish to make a request.

However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.\n\n\n\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\n\n\n\n\nIn the limited circumstances where we may require your consent to process your personal data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact us using the contact details listed below. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which your originally consented unless we now have an alternative legal basis for doing so.\n\n\n\nWhilst we will take all reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any that you disclose online for example when it is sent by email. You accept the inherent security risks of providing information online over the Internet and will not hold TSMC responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to TSMC’s negligence or wilful default.\nPlease note that our website and other digital platforms may contain links to third party websites or digital platforms which are provided for your convenience.
